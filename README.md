# Fun Flex - Console Games Hub in C

Welcome to **Fun Flex**, a collection of classic console games developed in C programming language. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, user input handling, and game logic implementation — all within a fun and interactive environment.

## Games Included
- **Truth or Dare** — A simple multi-player interactive game to test your honesty or bravery.
- **Tic Tac Toe** — The classic 3x3 grid game for two players, implemented with input validation and win/draw detection.
- **Snakes and Ladders** — A board game simulation where players race to 100, encountering snakes and ladders that alter their positions.

## Features
- User-friendly console interface with clear instructions.
- Support for multiple players.
- Randomized turns and dice rolls.
- Real-time game state updates and win condition checks.
- Modular code with functions for reusable game logic.

## Technologies Used
- **C Programming Language**
- Standard libraries: `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<string.h>`, `<time.h>`

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the code using GCC or any standard C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc funflex.c -o funflex
  3.Run the executable:
  ./funflex
Follow the on-screen menu to select and play games.

## Why This Project?
- Demonstrates mastery of core programming constructs.
- Showcases ability to manage user input, control flow, and game logic.
- Highlights experience in building interactive console applications.
- 
### Ideal for beginner to intermediate level programmers.
